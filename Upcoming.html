    <div class="abt"><div>About this:-</div>
        
        <div> Dontnod's latest narrative adventure follows the story of reunited twins Alyson and Tyler Ronan who have a special bond. Described as an "intimate thriller," the twins use their special bond to uncover the mysterious of a troubled - albeit loving - childhood. The game is set to explore the idea of memory and both twins are playable protagonists, which sounds very intriguing. As with past Dontnod games like Life is Strange, you'll be able to make choices that shape the twins' story.  Interestingly the story will unfold over three chapters that will all release in the summer, so you'll be able to experience the narrative journey from start to finish.

Every decision you make can offer you new opportunities or close you off to them, as well as take you to new areas and lead you to different story arcs. This choice and variety makes it sound very replayable, and the setting is set to present you with some difficult moral choices as you decide how to lead in the frozen wastes. </div>

        <div> DiRT 5 is the latest off-road driving experience from Codemasters, and this time we're going more extreme than ever. Along with tracks set across a global stage, including New York City, Rio de Janiero, and remote areas of China and Greece, the game will also offer more ways to play than ever before: four-player split-screen modes are returning, and there's a new game mode specifically designed for co-op play ranging from your couch to global online battles. Plus, there's even a narrative-driven career mode to explore, which will feature voice acting talents like Nolan North and Troy Baker. All of this can be played in a non-linear format too, so you get to play more of what you want.  </div>

    <div class="abt"><div>About this:-</div>
        
        <div>Make no mistake; 343 Industries' follow-up to 2015's Halo 5 is still a long way off, but it's definitely happening. Bearing a curious new sub-header and running on a brand new game engine known as Slipspace, the first Halo Infinite trailer almost seems to suggest that Master Chief's next adventure will have MMO qualities to it, or at least be more open-ended and sandbox-like in flavour. That instantly familiar shot of his armour also teases a potential technological downgrade for everyone's favourite Spartan, though plot details remain threadbare for now. MMO or otherwise, Halo: Infinite could just be the Halo comeback we've all been waiting for.

        <div>
As one of the first games to be announced for Sony's next-gen console, Godfall is set to land on the PS5 at the tail end of the year. Developer Counterplay Games describes it as a loot-driven action RPG, with a focus on real-time melee combat. The new IP is set in a fantasy universe with "heroic knights, arcane magic, and forbidden realms." The game can also be played in its entirety in co-op or solo as you so desire. We don't yet know much more about this looter-slasher, but the shiny action-packed trailer and the game's high fantasy setting is certainly attention-grabbing.

        <div> 
It's time to make a leap of faith into the Viking era with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the latest entry in Ubisoft's long-running series. You'll play as Eivor (male or female), a Viking raider who must lead their clan from the icy plains of Norway into a new home in England. This is the Dark Ages though, so England is a nation lead by a collection of petty lords and warring kingdoms. Will you conquer this land? You'll find out soon enough.
